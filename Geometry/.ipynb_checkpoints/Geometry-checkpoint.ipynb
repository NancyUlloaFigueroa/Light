    "## Classical geometry with more than just ruler and compass\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to summarize briefly what's the core of those folklore arguments: With a ruler and compass you can construct lines and circles (obviously) from certain given points, and by intersection, you get new points. When you consider equations for the circles and for the lines, you will see that you only have to deal with at most quadratic equations. Hence, every new point you construct with ruler and compass will come from a field extension of degree 1 or 2 . So, if you can construct something with ruler and compass, it must be contained in a field extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ that has degree $2^n$ for some $n$. But then, for squaring the circle, you need to construct $\\pi$ which is not algebraic; for doubling the cube, you need to construct $\\sqrt[3]{2}$, which has degree 3 over $\\mathbb{Q}$; and for trisection of an arbitrary angle you need numbers of degree 3 as well. Contradiction. __q.e.d.__\n",

    "## Trisect a given Angle $\\alpha$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fix notation, $\\alpha$ is set at a point $O$. Let's draw a circle of radius $r$ around $O$ (see the figure below), such that one of the lines defining $\\alpha$ can be considered the diameter of the circle. The other line that defines $\\alpha$ will cut the circle at a point $A$. Now, we set our marked ruler on the point $A$ and move it such that one of the two marks is on the circle, the other is on the diameter of the circle (the line through $O$ ). Thus, we have found a line segment of length $r$ between circle and line, passing the circle at point $C$ and the line at point $B$; and the prolongation of this line also passes through $A$. The angle $\\beta$ at $B$ between the new line and the diameter of the circle equals exactly $\\frac{\\alpha}{3}$.\n",

So the triangle $\\triangle O B C$ is isosceles and the angles at $B$ and at $O$ are equal. Similarly the triangle $\\triangle O A C$ is isosceles with equal angles at $C$ and $A$, let's call this angle $\\gamma$. The third angle of $\\triangle O A C$ at $O$ equals $2 \\pi-2 \\gamma$. But this angle is also $2 \\pi-\\alpha-\\beta$. So, $2 \\gamma=\\alpha+\\beta$ and hence $\\alpha=2 \\gamma-\\beta$. Then consider the angles at $C$ : one of them is $\\gamma$, the other one is $2 \\pi-2 \\beta$. But this other one is also $2 \\pi-\\gamma$. So we have $\\gamma=2 \\beta$. Taking everything together, we find $\\alpha=4 \\beta-\\beta=3 \\beta$. __q.e.d.__"

Then the triangles $\\triangle A B D$ and $\\triangle C E D$ are similar, so we have $\\frac{\\overline{C E}}{2}=\\frac{\\overline{A B}}{1}$ and thus $\\overline{C E}=2 \\overline{A B}=\\frac{k}{2}$. The triangles $\\triangle E C Q$ and $\\triangle B Q R$ are similar as well (by the parallel lines and the respective angles at $Q$ being equal). So, $\\frac{\\overline{C E}}{C Q}=\\frac{\\overline{B R}}{1}$ and hence $\\overline{C Q}=\\frac{\\overline{C E}}{B R}=\\frac{k}{2 B R}$. Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem twice in a row:\n",

This yields $\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2 B R}\\right)^2=1-\\left(\\frac{k}{8}\\right)^2+\\left(\\overline{B R}+\\frac{k}{8}\\right)^2$. By multiplying out and sorting all the terms, we find $4 \\overline{B R}^4+k \\overline{B R}^3-k^2-4 k \\overline{B R}=0$, and looking at this long enough, this is $(4 \\overline{B R}+k)\\left(\\overline{B R}^3-k\\right)=0$. Now, the first term gives $\\overline{B R}=-\\frac{k}{4}$, but this is negative and $\\overline{B R}$, being a line segment, needs to have positive length. So, the length of $\\overline{B R}$ needs to be a positive solution to the second term, and so $\\overline{B R}=\\sqrt[3]{2}$, as claimed (the other two solutions are not real). __q.e.d.__\n",
