    "According to this definition, impedance is similar to electric dc resistance which defines the ratio $\\mathrm{U} / \\mathrm{I}$ where $\\mathrm{U}$ and $\\mathrm{I}$ are constant in time. In an impedance measurement, however, an alternating ac voltage $\\mathrm{U}_0$ with a fixed frequency $\\omega / 2 \\pi$ is applied to the sample under test. $\\mathrm{U}_0$ causes a current $\\mathrm{I}_0$ at the same frequency in the sample. In addition, there will generally be a phase shift between current and voltage described by the phase angle $\\varphi$.\n",

    "Miniature radiofrequency (RF) coils have a variety of applications in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS). While they might appear useful only for chemical analysis of very small (nanolitre) volumes, they are increasingly used in human and animal studies. They have been used as fiducials to locate catheters and endoscopes, and also to obtain images from localized regions of tissue, aiming at micron-scale resolution. Another potential application is the spectroscopic evaluation of biopsy samples. Because devices are often single use, lowcost implementations are needed.\n",
