    "## Stream-Function for 2-D Current Lines Drawing in DC Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The stream function described is employed for the presentation of $2 \\mathrm{D}$ DC modeling results. The 2D model is understood as a 2D medium with linear current electrodes, oriented along the inhomogeneities' strike direction. In this case both the medium and the electric field depend on two space coordinates only. Modeling becomes much easier than considering point current electrodes, where the electrical field always is three-dimensional. Meanwhile the actual results of such modeling are qualitatively equivalent to $3 \\mathrm{D}$ modeling with point electrodes, as long as the measurements are conducted across the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical modeling presentation is in apparent resistivity which reflects an electric field distribution on the earth's surface. Quite often the connection of measured anomalies with a geoelectrical model is rather complex (fig. 1, A and C). The visualization of DC current lines simplifies understanding of the electric field's structure. Current lines are used in almost each textbook, but a practical technique for their construction is usually not included.\n",

    "The evident way for drawing current-lines is the step by step continuation of a line from some point along the electric field direction. The practical realization of such approach is not trivial. For a 2D field it is possible to use the stream-function. This function is often used in EM field modeling [flux function, Berdichevsky, 1984]. \n",
    "\n",
    "A contour map of the streamfunction corresponds to the stream-line distribution. Thus the problem of current streamlines' construction is reduced to the calculation of the streamfunction in the research area. This can be achieved by calculating secondary surface charges, which are determined at 2D modeling, using Fredholm's integral equation of the second type relatively of electric field [Escola, 1979].\n",
    "\n",

The value of the integral (1) does not depend on the integration's path in regions without current sources. Therefore the stream-function can be calculated by integration from any point.

The connection of stream-line distribution with apparent resistivity $\\left(\\rho_a\\right)$ depends on the kind of array. For pole-dipole array with ideal MN dipole the following relation is valid and exact:\n",

Therefore, if the upper layer is homogenous ( $\\rho_{M N}=$ const), then $\\rho_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is proportional to the current density. This approach clarifies the $\\rho_a$ physical explanation as shown in fig.1A. The current distribution around conductive object (fig.1B) results in changes of current density on the surface and this finds it's expression in $\\rho_{\\mathrm{a}}$ anomalies. $\\rho_{\\mathrm{a}}$ for pole-pole array is related to secondary charge distribution. An expression can be derived for the potential value in point $\\mathrm{M}\\left(U_M\\right): \\quad U_M=U_0+U_S$,\n",

We can calculate on its base current lines, potential lines and apparent resistivity isolines in vertical cross-section.
