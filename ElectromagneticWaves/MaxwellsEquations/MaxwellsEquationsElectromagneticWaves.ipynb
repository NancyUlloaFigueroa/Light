    "## The Equations\n",
    "Maxwell's four equations describe the electric and magnetic fields arising from distributions of electric charges and currents, and how those fields change in time. They were the mathematical distillation of decades of experimental observations of the electric and magnetic effects of charges and currents, plus the profound intuition of Michael Faraday. Maxwell's own contribution to these equations is just the last term of the last equation-but the addition of that term had dramatic consequences. It made evident for the first time that varying electric and magnetic fields could feed off each other-these fields could propagate indefinitely through space, far from the varying charges and currents where they originated. Previously these fields had been envisioned as tethered to the charges and currents giving rise to them. Maxwell's new term (called the displacement current) freed them to move through space in a self-sustaining fashion, and even predicted their velocity-it was the velocity of light!\n",

Thinking of the force lines as representing a kind of fluid flow, the so-called \"magnetic flux\", we see that for a closed surface, as much magnetic flux flows into the surface as flows out. This can perhaps be visualized most clearly by taking a group of neighboring lines of force forming a slender tube - the \"fluid\" inside this tube flows round and round, so as the tube goes into the closed surface then comes out again (maybe more than once) it is easy to see that what flows into the closed surface at one place flows out at another.

The answer is that it doesn't matter what surface you choose, as long as the wire forms its boundary. Consider two different surfaces both having the wire as a boundary (just as both the northern hemisphere of the earth's surface and the southern hemisphere have the equator as a boundary). If you add these two surfaces together, they form a single closed surface, and we know that for a closed surface $\\int \\vec{B} \\cdot d \\vec{A}=0$. This implies that $\\int \\vec{B} \\cdot d \\vec{A}$ for one of the two surfaces bounded by the path is equal to $-\\int \\vec{B} \\cdot d \\vec{A}$ for the other one, so that the two will add to zero for the whole closed surface. But don't forget these integrals for the whole closed surface are defined with the little area vectors pointing outwards from the enclosed volume. By imagining two surfaces spanning the wire that are actually close to each other, it is clear that the integral over one of them is equal to the integral over the other if we take the $d \\vec{A}$ vectors to point in the same direction for both of them, which in terms of the enclosed volume would be outwards for one surface, inwards for the other one. The bottom line of all this is that the surface integral $\\int \\vec{B} \\cdot d \\vec{A}$ is the same for any surface spanning the path, so it doesn't matter which we choose.\n",

    "# When Does Ampere's Law Go Wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example to see that something must be wrong with Ampere's Law in the general case is given by Feynman in his Lectures in Physics. Suppose we use a hypodermic needle to insert a spherically symmetric blob of charge in the middle of a large vat of solidified jello (which we assume conducts electricity). Because of electrostatic repulsion, the charge will dissipate, currents will flow outwards in a spherically symmetric way. Question: does this outward-flowing current distribution generate a magnetic field? The answer must be no, because since we have a completely spherically symmetric situation, it could only generate a spherically symmetric magnetic field. But the only possible such fields are one pointing outwards everywhere and one pointing inwards everywhere, both corresponding to non-existent monopoles. So, there can be no magnetic field.\n",

    "However, imagine we now consider checking Ampere's law by taking as a path a horizontal circle with its center above the point where we injected the charge (think of a halo above someone's head.) Obviously, the left hand side of Ampere's equation is zero, since there can be no magnetic field. (It would have to be spherically symmetric, meaning radial.) On the other hand, the right hand side is most definitely not zero, since some of the outward flowing current is going to go through our circle. So the equation must be wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ampere's law was established as the result of large numbers of careful experiments on all kinds of current distributions. So how could it be that something of the kind we describe above was overlooked? The reason is really similar to why electromagnetic induction was missed for so long. No-one thought about looking at changing fields, all the experiments were done on steady situations. With our ball of charge spreading outward in the jello, there is obviously a changing electric field. Imagine yourself in the jello near where the charge was injected: at first, you would feel a strong field from the nearby concentrated charge, but as the charge spreads out spherically, some of it going past you, the field will decrease with time."

    "# \"Displacement Current\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Maxwell referred to the second term on the right hand side, the changing electric field term, as the \"displacement current\". This was an analogy with a dielectric material. If a dielectric material is placed in an electric field, the molecules are distorted, their positive charges moving slightly to the right, say, the negative charges slightly to the left. Now consider what happens to a dielectric in an increasing electric field. The positive charges will be displaced to the right by a continuously increasing distance, so, as long as the electric field is increasing in strength, these charges are moving: there is actually a displacement current. (Meanwhile, the negative charges are moving the other way, but that is a current in the same direction, so adds to the effect of the positive charges' motion.) Maxwell's picture of the vacuum, the aether, was that it too had dielectric properties somehow, so he pictured a similar motion of charge in the vacuum to that we have just described in the dielectric. The picture is wrong, but this is why the changing electric field term is often called the \"displacement current\", and in Ampere's law (generalized) is just added to the real current, to give Maxwell's fourth—and final—equation."

    "Consider now how the magnetic field develops if the current in the sheet is suddenly switched on at time $t=0$. We will assume that sufficiently close to the sheet, the magnetic field pattern found above using Ampere's law is rather rapidly established.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we will assume further that the magnetic field spreads out from the sheet like a tidal wave, moving in both directions at some speed $v$, so that after time $t$ the field within distance $v t$ of the sheet is the same as that found above for the magnetostatic case, but beyond $v t$ there is at that instant no magnetic field present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now apply Maxwell's equations to this guess to see if it can make sense. Certainly Ampere's law doesn't work by itself, because if we take a rectangular path as we did in the previous section, for $d<v t$ everything works as before, but for a rectangle extending beyond the spreading magnetic field, $d>v t$, there will be no magnetic field contribution from the top and bottom of the rectangle, and hence\n",

    "We are forced to conclude that for Maxwell's fourth equation to be correct, there must also be a changing electric field through the rectangular contour.\n",

    "Let us now try to nail down what this electric field through the contour must look like. First, it must be through the contour, that is, have a component perpendicular to the plane of the contour, in other words, perpendicular to the magnetic field. In fact, electric field components in other directions won't affect the fourth equation we are trying to satisfy, so we shall ignore them. Notice first that for a rectangular contour with $d<v t$, Ampere's law works, so we don't want a changing electric field through such a contour (but a constant electric field would be ok).\n",

    "\n",
    "So, as long as the outward moving front of magnetic field, travelling at $v$, hasn't reached the top and bottom of the rectangular contour, the electric field through the contour increases linearly with time, but the increase drops to zero (because Ampere's law is satisfied) the moment the front reaches the top and bottom of the rectangle. The simplest way to get this behavior is to have an electric field of strength $E$, perpendicular to the magnetic field, everywhere there is a magnetic field, so the electric field also spreads outwards at speed $v$. Note that, unlike the magnetic field, the electric field must point the same way on both sides of the current sheet, otherwise its net flux through the rectangle would be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "After time $t$, then, the electric field flux through the rectangular contour $\\int \\vec{E} \\cdot d \\vec{A}$ will be just field $\\mathrm{x}$ area $=$ $E \\cdot 2 \\cdot v t L$, and the rate of change will be $2 E v L$. (It's spreading both ways, hence the 2 ).\n",

(This contour is all on one side of the current sheet.) The area of the rectangle the magnetic flux is passing through will be increasing at a rate $L v$ (square meters per second) as the magnetic field spreads outwards.\n",

    "This is how Maxwell discovered a speed equal to the speed of light from a purely theoretical argument based on experimental determinations of forces between currents in wires and forces between electrostatic charges. This of course led to the realization that light is an electromagnetic wave, and that there must be other such waves with different wavelengths. Hertz detected other waves, of much longer wavelengths, experimentally, and this led directly to radio, tv, radar, etc."
