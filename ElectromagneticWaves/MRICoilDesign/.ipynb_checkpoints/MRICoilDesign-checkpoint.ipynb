    "# Introduction \n",

    "An iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to design biplanar coils, which is used for dynamic magnetoencephalography to compensate for residual fields in the magnetic shielding room. The effects of magnetic shielding layers and plane's side length on the uniformity are both considered for designing coils. The iterative calculation is used to minimize the side length of the coil plane. The biplanar coils with $1.3-\\mathrm{m}$ side length are designed, which consist of three homogeneous-field coils ( $B_x, B_y$, and $B_z$ coils) and five gradient-field coils $\\left(d B_x / d y, d B_x / d z, d B_y / d y, d B_y / d z\\right.$, and $d B_z / d z$ coils). The coil system can produce homogeneous and gradient fields within $1 \\%$ error over the volume of $\\mathbf{4 0} \\mathbf{~ c m ~} \\times \\mathbf{4 0} \\mathbf{~ c m} \\times$ $40 \\mathrm{~cm}$. Through active magnetic shielding, the central field inside the magnetic room is reduced from 7.56 to $0.17 \\mathrm{nT}$, and standard deviation from the mean value in the target area falls from 1.366 to $0.177 \\mathrm{nT}$. The dynamic auditory stimulation experiment proves that the biplanar coil system will improve the quality of the evoked signals."

    "# Coil Design Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "We can characterise a current distribution $J$ that is confined to an $x-y$ plane using a two-dimensional stream function $\\Psi(x, y)$, chosen such that $\\nabla \\Psi \\times \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}=\\boldsymbol{J}($ since $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J}=0)$. The wire paths of a coil design that represents the current distribution correspond to the contours of the stream function. Planar current distributions which produce a uniform field along one of the Cartesian axes have shared symmetry with current distributions that generate specific field gradients, and this sharing of symmetry also applies to the stream functions. For example, in the case of a Helmholtz coil, two co-axial loops of radius a carrying the same current and placed a distance a apart in $\\mathrm{z}$ will produce a uniform field $\\mathrm{B}_{\\mathrm{z}}$ along the $\\mathrm{z}$ direction as shown in Fig.a. In this instance the stream function required to produce the field is symmetric in $\\mathrm{x}$ and $\\mathrm{y}$, and also symmetric in $\\mathrm{z}$ (as the loops carry the same current). If the current in one of the loops is reversed with respect to the other (so the stream function is now anti-symmetric in $\\mathrm{z}$, and symmetric in $\\mathrm{x}$ and $\\mathrm{y}$ ) then the result is a gradient in $\\mathrm{B}_{\\mathrm{z}}$ along the $\\mathrm{z}$ direction (i.e. a $\\mathrm{dB}_{\\mathrm{z}} /$ $\\mathrm{dz}$ coil) as shown in Fig.b. If the two loops are driven independently the currents can be set to produce both a field, and a field gradient simultaneously as shown in Fig.c. This involves applying the sum of the currents needed to produce a field and a field gradient to one loop and the difference to the other loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the symmetry of the coil stream functions required to generate each of the three uniform fields, the $\\mathrm{x}$ - $\\mathrm{y}$ symmetry is the same for $\\mathrm{B}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ (anti-symmetric in $\\mathrm{x}$, symmetric in $\\mathrm{y}$ and anti-symmetric in $\\mathrm{z}$ ) and $\\mathrm{G}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ (anti-symmetric in $\\mathrm{x}$, symmetric in $\\mathrm{y}$ and symmetric in $\\mathrm{z}$ ) coils, $\\mathrm{B}_{\\mathrm{y}}$ (symmetric in $\\mathrm{x}$, anti-symmetric in $\\mathrm{y}$ and anti-symmetric in $\\mathrm{z}$ ) and $\\mathrm{G}_{\\mathrm{y}}$ (symmetric in $\\mathrm{x}$, anti-symmetric in $\\mathrm{y}$ and symmetric in $\\mathrm{z}$ ) coils, and $\\mathrm{B}_{\\mathrm{z}}$ (symmetric in $\\mathrm{x}$, symmetric in $\\mathrm{y}$ and symmetric in $\\mathrm{z}$ ) and $\\mathrm{G}_{\\mathrm{z}}$ (symmetric in $\\mathrm{x}$, symmetric in $\\mathrm{y}$ and anti-symmetric in $\\mathrm{z}$ ) coils. Through a combined design process and careful control of the applied currents, three coil pairs can therefore be used simultaneously to generate the uniform fields and the associated gradients.\n",

    "The blue and red lines in Fig. 2 mean clockwise and counterclockwise directions of currents, respectively. A set of coils must be driven by a current source. Therefore, the additional black lines were used to connect blue and red loops. The slots of acrylic plates were machined along the blue, red, and black lines. Each \"red or blue slot\" was inserted one wire, and each \"black slot\" was inserted two wires in opposite directions. Therefore, the effect of additional wires in the \"black slots\" on coil uniformity can be eliminated. Finally, a set of coils can be made of a single wire. To produce such complex-shaped coils, extreme precision in the fabrication of the coil must be considered. Therefore, the error caused by the spatial error is simulated.\n",
