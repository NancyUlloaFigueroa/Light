    "One way to visualize this flow is to sketch the velocity field as a forest of little arrows in an $\\mathrm{x}-\\mathrm{y}$ grid each showing the direction and the magnitude of the velocity at a point in the flow field. However, for incompressible, steady-state, two-dimensional flow there is another tool that helps us visualize the flow. This tool is known as the streamline - a line in the flow field that is everywhere tangent to the velocity. Because a streamline is always tangent to the velocity at a every point along its length, there can be no flow across a streamline. The mathematical equation that describes the streamline in any flow is called a stream function.\n",
