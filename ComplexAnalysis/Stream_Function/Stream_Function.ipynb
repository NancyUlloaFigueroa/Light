The idea is to now consider two complex planes $(x, y)$ and $(X, Y)$. In the first plane we have the complex variable $z=x+i y$ and in the latter we have $Z=X+i Y$. If we construct a mapping $Z=F(z)$ which is analytic, with an inverse $z=F^{-1}(Z)$, then $W(Z)=w\\left(F^{-1}(Z)\\right)$ is also analytic, and may be considered a complex potential in the new co-ordinate system. Because $W(Z)$ and $w(z)$ take the same value at corresponding points of the two planes it follows that $\\Psi$ and $\\psi$ are the same at corresponding points. Thus streamlines are mapped into streamlines. In particular a solid boundary in the $z$-plane, which is necessarily a streamline, gets mapped into a streamline in the $Z$-plane, which could accordingly be viewed as a rigid boundary. Thus all we have done is distort the streamlines and the boundary leaving us with the key question: Given flow past a circular cylinder in the $z$-plane can we choose a mapping so as to obtain in the $Z$-plane uniform flow past a more wing-like shape? (Note that we have brushed passed some technical details here, such as the requirement that $d F / d z \\neq 0$ at any point, as this would cause a blow-up of the velocity)."
