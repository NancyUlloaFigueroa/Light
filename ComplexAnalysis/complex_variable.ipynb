For example, for low speed flows, the changes of pressure are small enough that they do not change the density of the fluid enough to account for. So we simplify the equations by assuming the density is constant. This is called incompressible flow. When the flow is VERY slow, the effects of inertia can also be ignored. In that case, called creeping flow, you can drop the time derivatives. In many cases, the changes of temperature associated with the flow are not important and then we don't need the energy equation, which is one of the equations in the full set.\n",
