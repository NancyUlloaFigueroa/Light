Since multiplication of complex numbers corresponds to multiplication of their matrix representations, raising to a power will correspond to raising to an equivalent power. Finally, division corresponds to multiplication by the inverse matrix. Therefore, the complex calculation $\\frac{\\left(z_1^*+z_2\\right)^2}{z_3}$ can be represented as a matrix calculation $\\left(M_1^{\\mathrm{T}}+M_2\\right)^2 M_3^{-1}$.\n",
