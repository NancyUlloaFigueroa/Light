    "Absolutely, unequivocally, not. Complex numbers are one of the cornerstones of modern mathematics, whereas the Quaternions are a way to generate division algebras. Division algebras are good for some stuff, like certain formulations of Class Field Theory, but honestly -- they're so much less significant than the complex numbers that it's ridiculous. They have some \"applications\" in physics, but those can all be formulated without the quaternions. They're just helpful notation. The complex numbers, however, carry depth because of: a. the fundamental theorem of algebra, and b. the (AMAZING!) theory that arises when you extend the definition of \"derivative\" to the theory of complex-valued functions. None of those things are interesting over the quaternions.\n"
