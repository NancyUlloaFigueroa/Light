    "Just like the complex numbers are made from the 'imaginary unit' $i$ that is defined by $i^2=-1$, you can make a 3D version of it by 'creating' some number $j$ with $j^3=-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the complex numbers generated by $i$ you get a free complex plane via stating that complex numbers are composed like $z=x+y i$ where the $x$ and $y$ represent coordinates in a plane...\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simple: the 3D version of such a number would be $X=x+y j+z j^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And with using $j^3=-1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The square of $X=(x, y, z)$ is given by: $X^2=\\left(x^2-2 y z, 2 x y-z^2, y^2+2 x z\\right)$ Basically you can now make all kinds of polynomials and Taylor expansions like, for example, $\\exp (X)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} X^n / n$ !.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets recall that for 'numbers' of the form $X=x+y j+y j^2$ where $j^3=-1$ there is a matrix associated that 'imitates' the way multiplication of vectors pan out. Of course that is, as a matrix:\n",

    "\n",
    "And a very elementary calculation yields:\n",
    "$D=(X))=x^3-y^3+z^3+3 x y z$ and if $D=0$ the inverse does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't have used my fancy software to show you a plot of $D=0$ but it is easy to find a few loose $(x, y, z)$ that fit $D=0$. The most important is $(x, y, z)=(1,-1,1)$ (and all multiples of course).\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector simply means $X=1-j+j^2$ and if you look at that as a complex number it is zero.\n",
    "So even without calculating the determinant for $(1,-1,1)$ you already know it has to be zero...\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to fractals it is clear that the surface given by $D=0$ will act as a strong attractor when you multiply by some $d \\in D$. And $D$ contains strange bedfellows, just calculate the square of $X=\\frac{1}{3}(1,-1,1)$ and conclude this is a solution to $X^2=X$.\n",
