    "With regard to a 3-dimensional form like $\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{i} \\mathbf{y}+\\mathbf{j z}$, should we not expect to say that, just as the operator $\\mathbf{i}$ rotates $\\mathbf{y}$ from the $\\mathbf{x}$ to the $\\mathbf{i}$ direction, the operator $\\mathbf{j}$ similarly rotates $\\mathbf{z}$ from the $\\mathbf{x}$ to the $\\mathbf{j}$ direction, orthogonal to both the $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{i}$ directions? Here, the complex number has three independent, or orthogonal components, represented by three orthogonal directions in a 3-dimensional complex number space. This is the straightforward extrapolation from 2 to 3 dimensions, assuming that the operator $\\mathbf{j}$ operates orthogonally to $\\mathbf{i}$, but is in all other respects identical to $\\mathbf{i}$. Then, just as $\\mathbf{i}^* \\mathbf{i}=\\mathbf{- 1}$, we have $\\mathbf{j}^* \\mathbf{j}=\\mathbf{- 1}$.\n",

    "A problem immediately arises, however. In the $3^{-}$ dimensional complex number space, we have three independent planes of rotation of vectors: the $\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{i}$ plane, the $\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{j}$ plane, and the $\\mathbf{i}, \\mathbf{j}$ plane.

This, however, is clearly not consistent with the behavioural description of the operators as simply $\\sqrt{-1}$. How can we say $\\mathbf{j i}=\\mathbf{j}$ ? How does the operator $\\mathbf{i}$ disappear, in a manner consistent with the operator descriptions?\n",
