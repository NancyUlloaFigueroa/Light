    "A curve-, line-, path- or contour integral extends the usual definition of an integral to the integration in the complex plane or in a multidimensional space. The term contour integral is typically reserved for line integrals in the complex plane but does not imply integration over a closed contour.\n",

    "Also note that \"Path integral\" is a homonym, which on one hand describes integration along a curve and on the other hand is a description in quantum mechanics that generalizes the action principle of classical mechanics.\n",

    "In mathematics, a line integral is an integral where the function to be integrated is evaluated along a curve.

Many simple formulae in physics, such as the definition of work as $W=\\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{s}$, have natural continuous analogues in terms of line integrals, in this case $W=\\int_L \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{s}) \\cdot d \\mathbf{s}$, which computes the work done on an object moving through an electric or gravional field $\\mathbf{F}$ along a path $L$.\n",
