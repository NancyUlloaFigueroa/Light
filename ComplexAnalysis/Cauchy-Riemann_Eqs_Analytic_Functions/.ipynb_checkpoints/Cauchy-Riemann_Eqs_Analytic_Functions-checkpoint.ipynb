    "The vanishing of $\\Delta z=\\Delta x+i \\Delta y$ is, however, not quite as straightforward as it is in the case of a real variable. In that simpler case, where we let $\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0$ to calculate $\\mathrm{g}^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathrm{x}_0\\right), \\Delta \\mathrm{x}$ only has to vanish along the one-dimensional real axis. That is, $\\Delta \\mathrm{x}$ can shrink to zero in just two ways: either from the left of $x_0$ or from the right of $x_0$. But in the complex case we must take into account that, since $z_0$ is a point in the complex, two-dimensional plane, then $\\Delta z$ can shrink to zero in an infinity of different ways (from the left of $\\mathrm{z}_0$, from the right of $\\mathrm{z}_0$, from below $\\mathrm{z}_0$, from above $z_0$ or, indeed, from any direction of the compass). So, just how does $\\Delta z \\rightarrow 0$ ?\n",
    "Mathematicians consider the most condition-free definition possible for the derivative to be the best definition, and so their answer to our question is: we want $f^{\\prime}\\left(z_0\\right)$ to be the same independent of how $\\Delta z \\rightarrow 0$. To have this be the case, as you might suspect, comes with a price. If $f=u+i v$ then the price for a derivative at you might suspect, comes with a price. If $\\mathrm{f}=\\mathrm{u}+\\mathrm{iv}$ then the price for a derivative at $\\mathrm{z}=\\mathrm{z}_0$ that doesn't depend on the precise nature of how $\\Delta \\mathrm{z} \\rightarrow 0$ is that $\\mathrm{u}$ and $\\mathrm{v}$ $\\mathrm{c}=\\mathrm{z}_0$ that doesn't depend on the precise nature of how $\\Delta \\mathrm{z} \\rightarrow 0$ is that $\\mathrm{u}$ and $\\mathrm{V}$ these conditions are satisfied at $\\mathrm{z}=\\mathrm{z}_0$ and at all points in a region (domain or neighborhood are terms that are also used) surrounding $\\mathrm{z}_0$, then we say that $\\mathrm{f}(\\mathrm{z})$ is an analyric function in that region.\n",

The Jacobian of a function $f(z)$ takes infinitesimal line segments at the intersection of two curves in $z$ and rotates them to the corresponding segments in $f(z)$.
